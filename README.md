# logistic-regression-practice

In this repository, I am using Python to create a linear regression model to predict whether or not a student gets into a university.

The purpose is to build aclassification model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based the scores from two exams.

This was completed for Machine Learning COSC A406 at Loyola University New Orleans.
